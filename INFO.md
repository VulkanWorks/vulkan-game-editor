## Structure of Appearance

### For looktype atlases

-   Maybe patternWidth is the amount of directions?
-   Maybe patternHeight is the amount of addons(base_outfit, addon1, addon2)?
-   Maybe patternDepth is the amount of distinct player positions (standing, mounted)?

Each FrameGroup holds one animation frame. The first FrameGroup holds the non-moving outfit.
